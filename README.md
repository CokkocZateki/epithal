# EPITHAL
EvE Python Industrial Tool Helper And Logic

EPITHAL is a industrial and market analysis app for EvE Online, 
which uses the ESI API to quickly provide price information
and estimated build and sell costs.

EPITHAL is presently an alpha release. As such, expect numerous
bugs. However, the core function of registering products and
running price reports on them is largely complete.

# System Requirement

EPITHAL should run on anything with a Python interpreter. If one
was not included with your OS, you can get one at https://www.python.org/

# License
