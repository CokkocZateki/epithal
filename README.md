# EPITHAL
EvE Python Industrial Tool Helper And Logic

EPITHAL is a industrial and market analysis app for EvE Online, which uses the ESI API to quickly provide price information and estimated build and sell costs.

EPITHAL is presently an alpha release. As such, expect numerous bugs. However, the core function of registering products and running price reports on them is largely complete.

# Features

Copy-paste materials lists from the EvE client to save as products in your portfolio. Then have EPITHAL calculate build costs and expected profit buying and selling in the trade hubs of your choice.

Or just run API-powered price checks on any item on the EvE market.

# System Requirements

EPITHAL should run on anything with a Python interpreter. If one was not included with your OS, you can get one at https://www.python.org/

# Installation

Click "Clone or download"->"Download ZIP". Unzip, then run epithal.py. Or git clone https://github.com/klyoungblood/epithal to a local directory, the run epithal.py.
